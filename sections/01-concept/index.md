# Birefly

1. **Application**:  
   Birefly is a **web-based application** designed to provide users with an intuitive, browser-accessible interface.
   Users interact with the application through a graphical user interface (GUI) for uploading documents, entering keywords, and downloading summaries, eliminating the need for installation.

2. **Web-Service(s)**:  
   The application functions as a **web service** hosted online, enabling document processing directly from the cloud. This ensures that users can access the tool from any device with internet connectivity.

3. **Data Processing Toolkit**:  
   Birefly integrates features typical of a data processing toolkit, combining:
   - **Text extraction** from documents (PDF and .txt).  
   - **Keyword-based analysis** for content filtering and focusing.  
   - **Summarization algorithms** to generate targeted, concise summaries.  
   The processing pipeline delivers outputs that can be consumed directly (e.g., downloadable PDF summaries).
   Users can process documents programmatically via terminal commands for automation and scripting.  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     birefly summarize --file document.pdf --keywords "key1, key2" --output summary.pdf
     ```

4. **Use Case**:  
   - Birefly addresses multiple use cases, including:  
     - Summarizing lengthy tenders for project evaluations.  
     - Condensing client briefs for quick analysis.  
     - Analyzing bids to identify key information.
